# haskhol-math
HaskHOL libraries for mathematical and structural reasoning.  See haskhol.org for more details.
As a fair warning, these libraries are currently very unstable and very undocumented.

See the readme from the `haskhol-deductive` repo for why this package needs to be built with `cabal build -j1`.
You should also be sure you have something else to do while you wait for it to build, because it takes a decent amount of time.
